# Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks

Project Description:
In today's competitive business landscape, customer churn has become a major concern for companies. Identifying customers who are likely to churn and taking proactive measures to retain them can significantly impact the bottom line. This project aims to develop a Python-based AI solution using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict customer churn and help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

Project Overview:
The Customer Churn Prediction project will involve leveraging historical customer data, including transactional data, demographic information, and user behavior, to train an RNN model. The RNN model will learn temporal dependencies within the data, allowing it to capture patterns and trends that traditional machine learning algorithms might miss.

The Python script will preprocess the dataset, perform feature engineering, and split it into training and testing sets. The script will then use the Keras library to build, train, and evaluate the RNN model. The model will be optimized using techniques such as dropout regularization and hyperparameter tuning.

Once the model is trained and validated, the script will use it to predict customer churn for new data. The predictions can be used to identify at-risk customers and prioritize retention efforts. The script will also provide insights into the most influential factors contributing to churn, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions to prevent customer attrition.

Key Features and Benefits:
1. Data preprocessing: The script will handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables, ensuring the dataset is ready for model training.
2. RNN model training: By utilizing RNNs, the script will capture the sequential nature of customer data, allowing for more accurate churn predictions.
3. Model optimization: The script will optimize the RNN model's architecture and hyperparameters to improve its performance and generalization capabilities.
4. Interpretability: The script will provide feature importance metrics to identify the key factors influencing customer churn, helping businesses understand the underlying drivers.
5. Decision support: Armed with predictions and insights, businesses can devise targeted retention strategies, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance overall customer experience.

Target Audience:
This project is suitable for businesses across industries that rely on a subscription-based or recurring revenue model. It can benefit customer success teams, marketing departments, and strategic decision-makers looking to reduce customer churn, improve customer loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

This Python project combines the power of deep learning with data mining techniques, empowering businesses to proactively address customer churn and enhance their long-term profitability.
